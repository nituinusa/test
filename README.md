[Predicting IRIS Species](https://github.com/sumitkumar-00/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/iris.ipynb)

IRIS dataset was split in 80/20 for training and testing respectively. Each of Logistic Regression, KNN and RandomForest models achieved 96.67% accuracy in predicting species of the iris flower

[Police Stops in Austin, TX](https://github.com/sumitkumar-00/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/austin_tx_police.ipynb)

This is an exploratory data analysis for police stops in Austin, TX

[Image Classification for numerals (MNIST)](https://github.com/sumitkumar-00/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/mnist.ipynb)

This is a simple convnet model using Keras and tensorflow as backend to classify handwritten numerals. Accuracy is 97.87% for this model

[Cat and Dog Image Classification (convnet)](https://github.com/sumitkumar-00/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/cat_and_dog.ipynb)

This is a classification model (convnet) to classify pictures of dogs and cats. 4k pictures of dogs and cats each were used for training. Test set had 1k pictures for each class. The model achieved accuracy of 77%. Data augmentation probably can be used to improve accuracy. That's a project for some other day

[Classifying credit data into defaulters/non-defaulters](https://github.com/sumitkumar-00/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/credit_default.ipynb)

This dataset contained 3 predictors ( student, balance and income) and one reponse default/no default. Dataset is imbalanced and only 3 percent of the 10K observation belong to default class. Randomforest classifier was able to achieve an area under curve equal to 0.89
